# VCFtoTree
Build phylogeny from [1000 Genomes] Phase 3 VCF file for 2504 individuals, also including ancient ([Neanderthal], [Denisovan]) and primate genomes.
[1000 Genomes]:http://www.1000genomes.org
[Neanderthal]:http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/index.html
[Denisovan]:http://www.eva.mpg.de/denisova/index.html

VCF --> fasta sequence (whole sequence, not just variable sites) --> Phylogeny

We provide a user friendly interface, in which you can choose the genomes you want to add into the phylogeny.

Raw scripts can be found in **Code** folder.
